Good CRC example from https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J44/6.7.6

a is 5, b is 3, and the result of a ^ b is 6. 

As explained by ChatGPT:

The result of a ^ b is 6 because the operation youâ€™ve described is not the usual exponentiation (where a raised to the power of b equals 6). Instead, it appears to be the bitwise XOR operation.

Letâ€™s break it down:

a is 5, which in binary is 101.
b is 3, which in binary is 011.
Now, letâ€™s perform the bitwise XOR operation:

  101
^ 011
------
  110


Also, another useful response from Chat:

What does this mean?   unsigned char message[3] = {0x83, 0x01, 0x00};

unsigned char: This declares an array of unsigned characters. In C, an unsigned char typically represents a single byte (8 bits) of data.

message[3]: This creates an array named message with a size of 3 elements. Each element can hold an unsigned char.

{0x83, 0x01, 0x00}: These are the initial values assigned to the elements of the message array. Letâ€™s break it down further:

0x83 represents the hexadecimal value 83.
0x01 represents the hexadecimal value 01.
0x00 represents the hexadecimal value 00.
Putting it all together, the message array contains the following values:

message[0] = 0x83 (131 in decimal)
message[1] = 0x01 (1 in decimal)
message[2] = 0x00 (0 in decimal)
These values can be used for various purposes, such as communication protocols, data packets, or configuration settings. The specific meaning depends on the context in which this array is used in your program. Remember that each value is represented in hexadecimal notation, which is commonly used in low-level programming. ðŸ¤“
