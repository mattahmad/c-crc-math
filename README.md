Good CRC example from https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J44/6.7.6

a is 5, b is 3, and the result of a ^ b is 6. 

As explained by ChatGPT:

The result of a ^ b is 6 because the operation you’ve described is not the usual exponentiation (where a raised to the power of b equals 6). Instead, it appears to be the bitwise XOR operation.

Let’s break it down:

a is 5, which in binary is 101.
b is 3, which in binary is 011.
Now, let’s perform the bitwise XOR operation:

  101
^ 011
------
  110
